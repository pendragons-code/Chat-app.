# What
This is just like any other socket.io example of the chat app example.          
I will, however, try to add in some things like VOIP and end to end encryption.

# This project
WILL NOT BE HOSTED, I AM NOT WILLING TO DEAL WITH DRAMA AND SECURITY.

# Progress
This first commit was only made in 10 mins time, so not everything is well thought through. At the same time. This project will likely not take a lot of time. And yes I am working on JASBOT and the other stuff still (request's deprecation and a lot more have been putting many devs at a headache.).      
I'm just making this for fun I think.

# DataBase
Might consider using a database like quick.db (I know key-value databases and their issues, but I really just need a simple one and I am not able to use mongodb since I will most likely writing code on replit and not my usual IDE.)

# WHAT? REPLIT?
Yes, I will be going to a new institue of education and my usual stuff will not be available to me. :( RIP TP-300LD             
So yeah, I will be forced to use windows. :( T-T
